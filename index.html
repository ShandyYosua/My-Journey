    <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>Hello my name is Shandy. I live in Pagedangan, Tangerang. If you confuse where is it Pagedangan, let me tell you. 
        Pagedangan area, very close to AEON Mall and Indonesia Convention Exhibition (<em>ICE</em>). 
        It's only take 10 - 15 by motorcycle.</p>
        <p>I have a few hobbies like reading, cycling and running. Now i'm learning JavaScript in Hacktiv8. 
        So this website is also part of my experiment of creating a website. 
        I'll tell you about my progress studying JavaScript at this website</p>
        <p>If you have advice for this website, please tell me :) Thank you</p>
